# Dynamic Web Pages with CSS

HTML is the content, CSS is the style. It can be used to control everything from font, color, backgrounds, image placement, image dimensions, article and section placement, how the words are wrapped or aligned.

CSS uses a variety of selectors to designate what sections of the webpage it will alter. Universal selectors change everything, class selectors choose an element with a class attribute, ID selectors alter previously assigned elements, and type selectors affect named elements.

Color is expressed in terms of light through RGB and each individual hue can be expressed in 8 bit (0-255, 00-FF), through percentages, and some by names. The saturation, brightness, and lightness can be modified as well which introduces or removes black and grey from the hue.
