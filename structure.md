# Structure Web Pages with HTML

Writing compelling webpages requires a basic understanding of marketing and how humans perceive information. Your visitors are unlikely to read everything and will skim over the majority of website. With that in mind, itâ€™s imperative to use visual hierarchy to draw their attention to your major points and be clear and concise with your words. Clean design and grouping similar objects helps them to identify patterns and navigate the site.

HTML is written and ordered with the use of HTML elements, denoted by angled brackets. With the advent of HTML 5, `<div id= "">` has mostly been replaced with simpler, more intuitive commands reduced down to their names such as:

```

<header>

<body>
    
<article>, etc.

```

It is within these brackets that words are divided and ordered into paragraphs, buttons, sidebars, and so on.
