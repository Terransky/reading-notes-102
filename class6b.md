1. While I've had a decent understanding of what a bit is and how images and sound are represented digitally by storing pixel data and wave forms, the video really impresses upon you just how many billions of bits over time that represents. It'd be the equivalent of me trying to communicate only by blinking at the speed of light.

2. I've never understood how bits communicate and this video visually demonstrates the use of circuits and how they can be wired together to make specific use circuits like adders.

3. I had never seen the inside of a CPU before or known how its circuits were organized. It's still unclear to me how, mechnically speaking, it can read memory. How does it pull the state of bits located in ram or drives?
