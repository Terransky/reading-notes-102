# Operators and Loops

You can use boolean logic to compare values to produce true and false results. Using this technique, it's possible to write conditional code that only executes when the conditions are true and otherwise if false.

Additionally, you can compare multiple conditions and require that they must all be true, only one must be true, or none may be true.

Taking it a step further, by utilizing loops, you can continually evaluate the conditions over a specified number of iterations. For example:

`for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {document.write(i);}>)`

will return the numbers "0123456789" all in a row. By adding more dynamic conditions, we can get the for loop to continue exercising until we want it to stop.
