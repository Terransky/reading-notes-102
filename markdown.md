# Learning Markdown

Markdown is a way to style text on the web, similar to html and CSS. We seem to be using it mostly because Github supports it. Rather than write out a bunch of <tags> or loading CSS style sheets, the built in markdown support lets us use simple prefixes and symbols such as # and * to denote lines as headers or lists, for example. A single hastag will style it as h1 with larger font and ## will style it as h2 with slightly smaller font and so on.

This ultimately allows us to style and flavour our text in ways that browsers can understand without having to install other word documents and processors or write out full web pages.
