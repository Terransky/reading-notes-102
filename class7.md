# Programming with JavaScript

JavaScript, like most programming languages, allows you to write series of instructions for computers to follow. Since computers can't think independently (yet), instructions must be quite detailed, specific, and orderly.

To program in JavaScript you use expressions amd operators. Expressions return a single value either by assignment or using other values to return a new value. Expressions can use operators to create values by:

assignment operators (=) sets a value
arithmetic operators return numeric values through math
string operators to store text
comparison operators to return boolean true or false
logical operators to combine multiple expressions

Functions are snippets of code that allow you to group a series of statements together. Functions are declared and called (invoked) later, making that code resuable and more easily modified. Functions can also be given parameters where they take input and use that input for its expressions.
